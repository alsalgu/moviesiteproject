# Al's Movie Picks

    Al's Movie Picks is a very simple Python project that lists six movies and their trailers. 

## How to Use

- Download .Zip folder and unzip it somewhere easily accessible (like your Desktop)
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) according to their instructions.
- Open up Python's shell, IDLE. This can be found in programs under the Python folder on PC.
- In IDLE, click on File in the menu bar and open up the directory in which you unzipped the files. 
- Here you'll find entertainment_center, fresh_tomatoes and media python files.
- Open up the one called 'entertainment_center.py'. That should bring it up in a separate window filled with its own code. 
- On the menu bar, click on Run and click 'Run Module'.
- Alternitavely, you can simply press F5.

### What's In in the Folder

- Entertainment_Center .Py
    - This file contains the movie's descriptions and trailer links. It also has the functions required to make the list of movies and to open up the page.

- Media .Py
    - This file contains the code that makes up the movie class, creating the necessary "template" for Entertainment_Center.Py to fill it in with movie details.

- fresh_tomatoes .py
    - This file contains the code that designs the page and all that good stuff. Beyond the realm of what I can really explain right now.
